A 697bhp SUV? Why not? Jeep's Trackhawk is more easy to understand than you may might suspect 

What are the Americans acceptable at, automotively talking? Indeed, they make great, enormous, comfortable SUVs, and they likewise like the odd madly amazing muscle vehicle. 

Put those two abilities into the blender and this is what comes out. SRT, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles' presentation arm, gave itself the work of building the world's quickest SUV. Maybe than wrecking about with smallish, twin-super V6s as you'd anticipate that an European firm should do, they essentially got hold of a Mopar Hellcat 6.2-liter V8 motor (total with ginormous supercharger, as of now found in the Dodge Charger and Challenger Demon), and heaved it into a Grand Cherokee. 

That 2.4-liter IHI supercharger alone has more inner removal than a whole Focus RS motor. The mechanical bundle puts 697bhp and 645lb ft of force at 4800rpm (which is entirely down on prior emphasess, on account of a less open exhaust) through a 4WD arrangement constrained by a 8-speed programmed with manual mode gearbox.

The 0-60mph time is 3.7sec, the 0-100mph 8.8sec, and the guaranteed top whack is 180mph. That last detail is basically dictated by the block like state of the vehicle. 

Outer Trackhawk changes comparative with the ordinary Grand Cherokee are very unpretentious: they're restricted to the odd nameplate and those greatest ever-utilized on-a-Jeep yellow Brembo brake calipers. Euro devotees will not particularly rate the nature of the inside, notwithstanding its ruggedness and Trackhawk logos, yet it offers good solace – what's more, purchasers in this market are bound to be keen on the metal pieces under the hood. 

In that regard they'll be satisfied by the measure of exertion Jeep has placed in. The internals have been given all in all a modify. This Hellcat V8 has never been needed to work with an AWD skeleton previously, so the trans, back driveshaft, CV joints and differential have all been modded and additional cooling added. 

We dealt with a fast blat in the Trackhawk around Nevada's Spring Mountain race circuit. Indeed, even our short spell consoled us that, in this application at any rate, there isn't anything to fear in the possibility of a tall SUV with beast power. 

Your underlying doubts are immediately eased by the shockingly non-fierce nature of the force conveyance. Clearly, slogging on the pedal delivers a substantial snarl and a sound slug of speed increase, yet away from the happiness of dispatch control it's all completely enlightened. It'll even sluggish up and turn in pleasantly toward the finish of a quick straight, because of the autonomous front suspension and Bilstein dampers. Indeed, even through a group of corners there's acceptable steadiness. It's no Lotus Elise, however for a monster of this size it cares for itself better than you'd anticipate. You'll get much more gear in it than you would in an Elise – and you'll most likely abandon it at the lights in the event that you utilize the dispatch control framework. By securing the supercharger sidestep valve, it preloads the blower to release force with a powerful whump. Shrewd and viable. 

Anyway, an ideal opportunity for the standard inquiry: who needs a 697bhp SUV? The response to that is, obviously, nobody. Yet, you could say that regarding whatever over-follows through on ordinary/fundamental transportation needs. 

A few changes might be made to the US-spec Trackhawks when they show up in the UK in pre-summer 2018. We don't have the foggiest idea what they may be, however accepting that they're positive mods, we're discreetly confident about the Trackhawk's potential as a genuine – and simultaneously superbly pointless – execution SUV.
